          <h2>
            Thereâ€™s a gap between the innovation and agility that African startups embody,
            and the socioeconomic conditions they work under. To adapt to a future of work
            where borderless opportunities exist, companies that wish to survive must
            approach their HR processes with creativity. DesignThink is helping companies
            bridge this gap by cultivating empowered teams and creating strategies to
            attract world-class talent.
